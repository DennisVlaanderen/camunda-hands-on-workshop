# Engine

This folder contains the basics for building a Camunda Engine using Spring Boot.
There are example configuration files in the `config` package with commented out code so the engine runs barebone.
The comments in each file explain its purpose or link to extra information necessary (i.e. setup guides for plugins).


## Modification

This entire codebase can be modified as a normal Spring Boot project.
This means you can define your own custom REST-endpoints in case you want to filter out the basic Camunda endpoints.
